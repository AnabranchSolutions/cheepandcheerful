## Context Matters ##
Rivers are everywhere. Some begin among alpine peaks and cascade down steep mountain ranges, others begin in the gentler landscapes and wind through meadows, others run at the bottom of desert canyons where it seems no water would run, others flow through tropical forests or boreal landscapes. While all rivers are formed by similar physical processes, the climatic and geologic context in which they take place exert dramatic controls on the rates and magnitudes of those processes and therefore their form. Furthermore, climatic and geologic setting influence the types of flora and fauna that live along river corridors and often form complex feedback loops with river character and the river ecosystem. Understanding these controls, the way they influence river form and function, and how they have changed in response to human and natural disturbances are critical steps in attempting to restoration. Recognizing the diversity of streams and rivers also forces us to question how different rivers respond to restoration. Should we expect different rivers to respond differently to similar restoration actions? How does the regional and local context help to inform river restoration projects? What information is needed to make informed decisions? There are a number of comprehensive protocols and guides to help river restoration practitioners understand their watershed (See [Resources and Links](resources_and_links.html)).

The objective of this section is to help restoration practitioners and land managers develop projects that that are appropriate to their specific setting by learning what questions to ask. The broad goal is to emphasize the importance of specific watershed context and location within the watershed when developing and implementing restoration projects.

### Inter-watershed variability: Not all watersheds are equal ###
The great diversity of rivers reflects a great diversity in watersheds. Watersheds come in different shapes and sizes; they are located in different climatic regions, with different topography, vegetation and soils. They have been influenced by differing degrees of human alteration and natural disturbance. This section compares and contrasts two hypothetical watersheds by posing a series of question and answers. The goal here is not to understand precisely how these differences affect how river restoration projects would proceed in each of these cases, but rather to highlight how important watershed-scale differences need to be taken into consideration.

#### Hydrology and Climate  <!-- this section is just to get folks thinking, these aren't the questions that are showing up later.-->
##### What is the natural flow regime?#####
* Magnitude - What are the range of flows?
* Frequency- How often do flows of a certain magnitude occur?
* Duration - How long do flows last?
* Timing - When do flows occur?
* Rate of change - How quickly to flows change?


* What is the annual precipitation?
* When does it fall?
* Does it fall as rain or snow?

#### Geology ####

* What is the dominant rock type?
* What is the dominant soil type?
* How does the geology/soil influence storm runoff response?
* What landscape features characterize the watershed?


Addressing questions that help characterize the variability in watersheds helps contextualize and understand the drivers that produce the variety of river shapes and sizes we see across climatic and geologic zones.


## Intra-watershed variability: differences within a watershed ##
Examining the large scale drivers or river variability are helpful to understanding the importance of watershed context, however most restoration projects take place within a single, discrete catchment and often at scales of 10^2 m. In such cases inter-watershed variability is less important than intra-watershed variability. In this case questions of location within the drainage network and upstream controls on river response become important.

#### Location within the Catchment ####
* Is the restoration reach located in the headwaters, piedmont, or lowland valley?
* Does the restoration reach have tributaries above that contribute water and sediment?
* How do the tributary characteristics compare to restoration reach?
* Are their natural or anthropogenic features affect the transport of water and sediment? E.g., dams, lakes, unconfined valley (storage zones), confined valleys?
* What are the dominant geomorphic disturbance processes? I.e., Do hillslope processes influence channel form and function? Mass wasting events?
