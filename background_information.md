River restoration is an interdisciplinary practice that integrates physical, biological and social sciences. <!--It also involves diverse stakeholders and community participation. should have a section on something pertaining to the social/community aspect--> In some cases those interested in implementing river restoration projects may not have an extensive background in these areas. The purpose of this section is to introduce some fundamental concepts and terms that are required in order to understand the approaches described throughout this site. This section focuses on the physical sciences, the "nuts and bolts," required to understand how rivers behave and respond to different actions. In addition to a short explanation of each of the following concepts, its relation to cheap and cheerful restoration work is briefly described.

There is a rich and extensive literature on the processes that shape and are shaped by river and floodplain ecosystems. For more information readers are directed to the [References](references.md) page.

### Concepts ###

*Equilibrium and Natural Range of Variability*

River are dynamic systems whose form can change over time. Over short time scales (1-10 years)<!--reasonable?--> river form may appear unchanging, or static, such that an observer visiting a particular reach may easily recognize it to be the same, its form nor location having changed. Over long (100-1000 yrs) time scales, rivers may adjust to change in response to changes in climate, land use or other disturbances (e.g., fire, urbanization, extirpation of beaver). Equilibrium means that the net amount of sediment being delivered to a certain reach equals that transported out of the reach. It does not mean that the river will not move across the landscape. Unconfined meandering rivers illustrate how a river that has not been influenced by any natural or human caused changes will migrate laterally across its floodplain. While the precise location of the river may change, its behavior and the processes at work are fundamentally the same. Lateral migration is a combination of erosion that takes place on the outside of a meander bend and deposition that takes place on the point bar on the inside of the meander bend. Such processes are critical to creating and maintaining instream and floodplain habitats. Evidence of past migrations is easily viewed in satellite imagery available from such platforms as Google Earth or Google Maps. ![Rio Negro meadners](images\photos\Rio_Negro_meanders_lateral_migration.JPG)

Systems such as those described above are not stable in the sense that their form is unchanging or static, rather their characteristic form and the processes that influence them vary around a mean.<!--s/b good figures for this--> Designing appropriate river restoration projects requires that we to understand the natural range of variability of healthy river systems and recognize that when natural processes such as water and sediment delivery, and large wood recruitment are intact specific river morphology at any point in space and time is variable within a natural range and that attempting to impose a static form by controlling the boundary conditions (e.g., bank armoring) limits natural river processes.

Ecologists recognize the role of disturbance as critical to maintaining a mosaic of habitats that promotes a diverse and resilient ecosystem. Within the river environment changing forms, lateral migration, LWD inputs contribute to creating physically heterogeneous systems that are essential for diverse ecological communities.


*Flow Regime*

The flow regime describes the characteristics of flow that influence the physical processes of erosion and deposition as well as the riparian and floodplain communities they support. The flow regime of any given river system is characterized by five attributes (Poff et al., 1997):

1. Magnitude – The volume of water moving past a given point at any given time interval.
2. Duration – The period of time associated with a specific flow magnitude.
3. Frequency – How often a flow of a given magnitude occurs.
4. Timing/Predictability – The regularity of flows of a given magnitude (e.g., snowmelt driven peak annual flows)
5. Rate of Change/Flashiness – How quickly flows change in magnitude.

*Geomorphic Units*

Geomorphologists, hydrologists and stream ecologists all seek to describe riverine attributes that are important to restoration goals. Often, increasing pool-riffle sequences, or backwater habitats are important restoration goals. Geomorphic units are topographically defined features that make up all riverine and floodplain environments and are defined by their shape and location within the river corridor. Pools, riffles, steps, backwaters, point bars and floodplains are examples of geomorphic units. Surveying the assemblage of geomorphic units present along restoration reaches helps practitioners describe the current conditions, potential reference conditions, and desired restoration outcomes.

*Structural Elements*

Structural elements are discrete elements that exert a direct influence on stream hydraulics and therefore patterns of erosion and deposition. Structural elements often cause flow separation, backwater effects and convergent flow that creates physical complexity. Examples of structural elements include rock outcrops, large woody debris and beaver dams as well as man-made elements such as rip rap, bridge piers etc.

*Valley margin*

The valley margin is the margin between a bedrock hillslope and the alluvial sediments that make up the valley floor. The valley floor can be composed of contemporary floodplains, historic floodplains (terraces) and alluvial fans.  

*Valley bottom margin*

The valley bottom margin is the margin the divides the active channel and contemporary floodplain from other valley floor features such as terraces and alluvial fans. In general the valley bottom margin is the margin that defines whether a stream is confined, partially confined or unconfined which exerts a major control on river behavior.

*Stream power*

Much previous work that has attempted to describe beaver dam viability/persistence has focused on channel gradient or discharge. While each of these is rooted in conceptually sound reasoning (e.g., beavers do not build dams on waterfalls, nor on the Colorado River in the Grand Canyon), beavers are capable of building dams on surprisingly steep streams and also on streams with a great range of discharge. Stream power is a variable commonly used in many geomorphic and hydraulic analyses that combines the effects of discharge and slope and is therefore able to better account for the combination of factors (discharge and slope) that affect beaver dam persistence/stability. Beaver are capable of building dams in steep drainages when discharge is low, a common occurrence in many mountainous headwater streams. The table below presents a simplified matrix of the relationship between channel gradient, discharge and beaver dam persistence.


Figure 1 Simplified matrix showing beaver dam persistence as a function of both slope and discharge. In assessments that rely on slope and gradient separately only the category in red would be predicted to have beaver dams. Using stream power allows for a more nuanced prediction that accounts for the variability streams and rivers.

<!--Stream power is defined as:
Ω=γQS
Where: 		γ is the specific weight of water (9800 N/m3)
		Q is discharge (m3/s)
		S is slope (m/m)-->


*Natural Range of Variability*

Rivers tend to have characteristic forms based on the climatic, geologic and geomorphologic setting in which they occur. The natural range of variability for a given river describes the range of morphologies that may occur rather than a single, static form. These morphologies are a product of the processes that act on the river system that have variable magnitudes and frequencies. As a result a given reach of river may exhibit multiple forms through time. The challenge for river restoration is identifying what conditions exist within the natural range of variability and what states represent a departure from the natural range, and are therefore in need of restoration. This information is best assessed through watershed assessments that identify current and historic climatic, geologic, geomorphologic and anthropogenic control on river behavior.

*Alternative Stable States*

A river can be classified as degraded if it is not possess by the physical and ecological processes that characterize its unaltered state. However such a state may also be ‘stable,’ such that the river is unlikely to change its condition in the absence of external disturbance or restoration. In many cases 'stability' may also be defined as a lack of sediment delivery from the reach. In such cases restoration practitioners need to identify the historic condition and determine an appropriate goal for restoration. The goal may be a return to the historic condition or a new condition based on current constraints.

*Channel Incision and Recovery*

Channel incision is a widespread problem that influences a number of physical processes that lead to the degradation of aquatic, riparian and floodplain ecosystems. Channel incision lowers the elevation of the streambed, resulting in lowered channel-floodplain connectivity and lowered water tables, which limits water availability for riparia. Because of their effect of water tables, incised channels can reduce baseflow discharges which can result in warmer temperatures and fewer available late summer habitat areas for fish. These consequences, in turn, prevent the continued recruitment and growth of a healthy riparia which can reduce shading and instream wood recruitment which promote ecosystem degradation. As streams incise and channel floodplain connectivity decreases, the energy of high flow events is concentrated on the channel bed and banks, which can lead to further incision or bank erosion.

Mulitple channel-incision evolution models have been proposes: Below the model by Schumm et al and Pollock et. al (2014) are shown.

It is important to recognize that in both channel evolution models the stream eventually returns to a state of dynamic equilibrium. The question for river restoration is whether or not the costs associated with degradation and the time scale on which natural recovery can take place are great enough to justify a more active intervention. 


*Source, Transfer and Accumulation Zones- General basin trends*
<!-- this could be a lot of information: RCC, Schumm, Flood Pulse, Process Zones etc etc etc. what is useful, what is too much?-->
Within a basin there are a number of processes and attributes that exhibit a general trend from headwaters to mouth. Among these are trends in gradient, channel width, channel substrate, channel-floodplain interactions, stream power, riparian communities and temperature. Understanding the location of potential restoration reach within the larger context of a watershed helps 1) prioritize restoration treatments 2) design appropriate restoration and 3) develop realistic objectives and expectations.
